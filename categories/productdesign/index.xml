      <description>Mosquito bats work great for killing mosquitoes and flies. Until they don&amp;rsquo;t work! They hardly last one mosquito generation. It turns out that the rechargeable battery in them go bad fairly quickly. So as a small hack, I took out the cheap battery they come with and replaced it with a decent rechargeable LiIon 3.7v 2200mah one. You have to modify the battery housing a little bit by carving out some extra bits of plastic to make the 18650 type battery to fit.</description>
